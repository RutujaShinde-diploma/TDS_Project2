Use the undirected network in `edges.csv`.

Return a JSON object with keys:
- `edge_count`: number
- `highest_degree_node`: string
- `average_degree`: number
- `density`: number
- `shortest_path_alice_eve`: number


Answer:
1. How many edges are in the network?
2. Which node has the highest degree?
3. What is the average degree of the network?
4. What is the network density?
5. What is the length of the shortest path between Alice and Eve?
